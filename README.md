# CS250
Below are 3 questions I was asked to answer on the last week of the CS250 semester in April 2022. Here goes my best shot at these "big questions".

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I first listen to the user needs and try to really understand what it is the user wants. As well as the priority of the wants. Once I understand the wants it is purly just coding to implement the program. I really believe coding is the easy part. The really understanding is difficult. Creating user stories helps by making the wants more clear. Especially the So I can... portions. The why is critical. Maybe the user doesnt really know how but does know what they want to do with it.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach developing programs in an inside out method. Small functionality leveraged to do complicated things. One of the Agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work is the test as I develope. Also develop quickly, fail quickly. I really like the idea of finding out quickly, is this going to work, or am I on the wrong path.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I think being a good team member in software development means being on time. On time with deliverables, to meetings, etc, and documentation. I think that if you explain what you are doing and are always available then you are a good team member. Communicate.
  
  This was a great class. I think it really will have a large impact in my caree.
